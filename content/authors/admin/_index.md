Hi ! I am a Ph.D. student working jointly between ENS Paris and FAIR Paris. My research interests focus of the theoretical aspects of deep learning : understanding the fundamentals of how neural networks learn from data.

I also write science books in my spare time. I recently published "Comprendre la Révolution de l'Intelligence Artificielle" at First Editions.
