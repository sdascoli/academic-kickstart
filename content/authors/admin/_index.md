Hi ! I am a Ph.D. student working jointly between ENS Paris and FAIR Paris. My research interests focus of the theoretical aspects of deep learning : understanding the fundamentals of how neural networks learn from data.

I am also passionate about outreach, and write popular science books. In my spare time I play the clarinet, feel free to check out my videos !
